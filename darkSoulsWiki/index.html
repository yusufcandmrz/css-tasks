                    <b>Dark Souls</b> is a 2011 action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware and published by
                    Namco
                    Bandai
                    Games. A spiritual successor to FromSoftware's Demon's Souls, the game is the first in the Dark
                    Souls
                    series. The game takes place in the kingdom of Lordran, where players assume the role of a cursed
                    undead
                    character who begins a pilgrimage to discover the fate of their kind. A port for Windows featuring
                    additional content, known as the <b>Prepare to Die Edition</b>, was released in August 2012. It was
                    also
                    released
                    for consoles under the subtitle Artorias of the Abyss in October 2012.

                    Dark Souls has been cited as one of the greatest video games ever made. Critics praised the depth of
                    its
                    combat, intricate level design, and use of flavor text. However, the game's difficulty was both
                    praised
                    and
                    criticized for being unforgiving. The original Windows version of the game was less well-received,
                    with
                    criticism directed at several technical issues. By April 2013, the game had sold over two million
                    copies
                    worldwide. Its success led to the development of two sequels—Dark Souls II (2014) and Dark Souls III
                    (2016)—while a remastered version was released in 2018.
