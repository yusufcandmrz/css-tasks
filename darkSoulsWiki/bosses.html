                        <p>
                            Created by the Bed of Chaos, the Asylum Demon protects the Northern Undead Asylum. Though
                            its
                            purpose is still unconfirmed, it is theorized that the Asylum Demon was placed at the
                            Asylum's
                            exit in order to ensure that only the strongest Undead can enter Lordran. Gwyn, the Lord of
                            Cinder and ruler of Lordran, likely wanted only the strongest Undead to exit the Asylum so
                            that
                            they could be pushed toward linking the fading First Flame.

                        <p>
                            Created when the Witch of Izalith disastrously attempted to create her own First Flame, the
                            Taurus Demon is considered a lesser demon, being one of the weakest of his kind. Being
                            located in the Undead Burg, the Taurus Demon is quite far from its home of Izalith.

                            Though the exact reason for its appearance in the Undead Burg isn't known, it has been
                            speculated that the Taurus Demon was sent on some mission by the Bed of Chaos to take back
                            the Burg from its human settlers, but has gone hollow in the process. This could explain the
                            appearance of a Black Knight stationed near the Demon's fog gateway, as these warriors
                            fought the Demons years prior at the request of Gwyn.

                        <p>
                            Acting as the protectors of the first Bell of Awakening, the Bell Gargoyles are designed to
                            test any Undead who seeks to link the First Flame. If an Undead manages to defeat the Bell
                            Gargoyles, and rings the bell, then that being takes on the prophesied mantle of the Chosen
                            Undead.
